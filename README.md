# Semantic-segmentation-based-on-FCN-ResNet101
Semantic segmentation based on FCN-ResNet101, which was pretrained, so it's convenient and precise.

## Here are its features : 
- the model was trained based on the data Pascal VOC, which contains 20 object classes and 1 background class.
  - the object classess contains 4 sub classess: people, animals, cars and Indoor goods.
- the model ResNet-101 will be used in this project.
- the model is huge, so while using for prediction, lots of memory will be cost, so it is recommended to run each image in a different program
